materials

Parts:


Arduino Uno R3

LED diodes (1 per channel)

220–1kΩ resistors (typical 220Ω)

Jumper wires, breadboard

USB cable (Arduino ↔ PC)

Wiring (for each LED):

Arduino digital pin → resistor (220Ω) → LED anode (long leg)

LED cathode (short leg) → Arduino GND
(If many LEDs, use a separate 5V supply and common ground. But discrete LEDs on Uno pins at low current usually OK.)


Example mapping (changeable in code):


Note 60 (Middle C) → Arduino pin 2

Note 61 → pin 3

Note 62 → pin 4
... etc.
